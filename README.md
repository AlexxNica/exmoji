Terminology Note
----------------
This library uses the term "char" extensively to refer to a single emoji glyph
in string encoding.  In Elixir/Erlang char means something specific, which
may be confusing because of the charlist/bitstring division (this library uses
bitstrings).  I may rename all those API functions for this version of the lib
because of that, but for now I'm keeping it consistent with other versions...
